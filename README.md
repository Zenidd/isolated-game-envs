# isolated-game-envs

Isolated game environments on demand.

This web application has been developed to allow users to run private game servers in a quick and straightforward way.

It includes an authentication system so secure and personalized access is ensured.

After selecting the kind and size of the server via the user interface, the application automatically manages the deployment in the cloud through an API designed to create and delete resources on-demand. This API also updates the registries of each deployment in the database, ensuring accurate tracking of users.
